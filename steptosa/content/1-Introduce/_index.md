**AWS Cloud9**  is an integrated development environment, or IDE.

The AWS Cloud9 IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, and a built-in terminal. It contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, and debug software, and helps you release software to the cloud.

You access the AWS Cloud9 IDE through a web browser. You can configure the IDE to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys, enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more.

### Benefits
### CODE WITH JUST A BROWSER
  **AWS Cloud9** gives you the flexibility to run your development environment on a managed Amazon EC2 instance or any existing Linux server that supports SSH. This means that you can write, run, and debug applications with just a browser, without needing to install or maintain a local IDE. The Cloud9 code editor and integrated debugger include helpful, time-saving features such as code hinting, code completion, and step-through debugging. The Cloud9 terminal provides a browser-based shell experience enabling you to install additional software, do a git push, or enter commands.

### CODE TOGETHER IN REAL TIME
AWS Cloud9 makes collaborating on code easy. You can share your development environment with your team in just a few clicks and pair program together. While collaborating, your team members can see each other type in real time, and instantly chat with one another from within the IDE.

### BUILD SERVERLESS APPLICATIONS WITH EASE

AWS Cloud9 makes it easy to write, run, and debug serverless applications. It preconfigures the development environment with all the SDKs, libraries, and plug-ins needed for serverless development. Cloud9 also provides an environment for locally testing and debugging AWS Lambda functions. This allows you to iterate on your code directly, saving you time and improving the quality of your code.

### DIRECT TERMINAL ACCESS TO AWS

AWS Cloud9 comes with a terminal that includes sudo privileges to the managed Amazon EC2 instance that is hosting your development environment and a preauthenticated AWS Command Line Interface. This makes it easy for you to quickly run commands and directly access AWS services.

### START NEW PROJECTS QUICKLY
AWS Cloud9 makes it easy for you to start new projects. Cloud9’s development environment comes prepackaged with tooling for over 40 programming languages, including Node.js, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and C++. This enables you to start writing code for popular application stacks within minutes by eliminating the need to install or configure files, SDKs, and plug-ins for your development machine. Because Cloud9 is cloud-based, you can easily maintain multiple development environments to isolate your project’s resources.
